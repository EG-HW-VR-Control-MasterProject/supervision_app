# 1 Integrated Robotics Project
This repository contains a application which allows to communicate with the turtlebot3 with the programs implemented in this repository: (https://github.com/EnzoGhisoni/SearchAndRescueRos).
The aim of the application is to interact with the robot by performing teleoperation and semi-autonomous navigation. The application has an access to the camera of the robot and the map generated by the robot during its exploration. The map is a clickable element which allows to send a goal for the robot navigation system.
